# VISAI Hackathon
### Welcome to the VISAI repository.
This repository holds the codebase for our project developed during the VISAI hackathon. Our project focuses on power consumption forecasting and recommendation systems, utilizing the capabilities of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks.

## Data
The data in this repository is organized into two main categories: overall power consumption measured with smart meters and individual plug power consumption data. The data is sampled at a rate of 1Hz.

Explore the data documentation to understand the dataset structure:
[01_doc.txt](data/01_doc.txt), 
[READ_ME_FIRST.txt](data/READ_ME_FIRST.txt)

## Dataset
The [dataset](dataset/) folder includes the implementation of a PyTorch dataset, which is essential for loading the sequences required for training.

## Getting Started
To get started with our project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ponakilan/VISAI.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd VISAI
```
